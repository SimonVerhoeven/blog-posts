A **functional analyst** is responsible for analyzing and understanding the functional requirements of a software system. They work closely with stakeholders, such as clients or end-users, to identify their needs and translate them into functional specifications that can be used by developers to build the software.

<br>
The role of a functional analyst is critical to the success of a software development project. Without a functional analyst, there is a risk that the software will not meet the needs of the stakeholders, resulting in a product that is not useful or effective. The absence of a functional analyst can also lead to misunderstandings between stakeholders and developers, resulting in delays, rework, and increased costs.

<br>
If a functional analyst is absent from a software development project, the project may experience a number of negative consequences. For example, there may be a lack of clarity around the project requirements, leading to misunderstandings and delays. The software may not be able to meet the needs of the stakeholders, resulting in dissatisfaction with the final product. There may also be a lack of coordination between the different teams involved in the project, leading to inefficiencies and errors.

<br>
It is therefore important to have a talented functional analyst on a software development project. At itenium, **our functional analysts have the expertise and experience needed to ensure that your project requirements are well understood**, and that the software is built to meet those requirements. By **working closely with stakeholders and developers**, our functional analysts can help to ensure that your software development project is a success.
